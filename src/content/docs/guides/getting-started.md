description: Get Started with Code Genie

In this guide we'll walk through how to generate your first application with Code Genie, deploy it to your AWS Account, and run it locally for development.

## Define your application's data model

Code Genie applications are generated based on a data model that describes the application's Entities, Properties, Relationships, and other metadata. JSON Schema is used for defining entities, with extensions that allow you to define additional details such as relationships and other customizations.

See the reference application data model for an example.

## Generate and download your application's source code

Self-service generation is still under development. Until then, contact brett@codegenie.codes.

## Deploy your application to AWS

See the `README.md` in your application's project for further instructions.

## Run and develop your application locally

See the `README.md` in your application's project for further instructions.
